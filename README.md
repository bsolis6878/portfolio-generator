Welcome to the Portfolio Generator! Created using the inquirer package, Javascript, and CSS, use this application to generate a portfolio with as many projects you've worked on as you like. To run this app, clone the repository and use node app.js as demonstrated below to be prompted for the information you'd like to be demonstrated on your portfolio. After finishing the prompts, your portfolio will be available in the dist folder!
